# The Activity Lifecycle 
- What
    - As a user navigates through, out of, and back to your app, the Activity instances in your app transition through different states in their lifecycle.

- Why
    - We need to know that a state has changed to declare how your activity behaves when the user leaves and re-enters the activity.
